Generates and Emails iCalendar events

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/angstwad/fortnight/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/angstwad/fortnight/latest)

## About 

Fortnight was intended to make creating and emailing iCalendar events per
RFC 2445 much easier, since it currently sucks.  This was ripped out of an
application and into a library to make sharing it more sane.

## IOU

I owe you...

1. Documentation
2. Examples
3. A README worthy of its name

*Fortnight was made with love, sorta, by myself and @sivel.*
